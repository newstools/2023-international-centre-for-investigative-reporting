PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has departed the Umar Musa Yar’Adua International Airport, Katsina, for Doha, Qatar, to attend the Fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries (LCDs). Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State and some other government officials were at the airport to bid the president farewell. A statement today by the president’s media aide, Garba Shehu, informed that Buhari was invited to the conference by the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. The conference will be attended by world leaders, the private sector, civil society groups, and youth organisations. According to the statement, the conference, among other things, seeks to share developmental ideas and mobilise actions and solutions to transform the LDCs by finding sustainable solutions to poverty, food insecurity, hunger, and weak or non-existent infrastructure. The conference will also address inadequate healthcare facilities and climate change in LCDs as they struggle to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. In the president’s delegation are some ministers and other government officials. President Buhari is expected to return to his country home, Daura, Katsina State, on March 8 in preparation for voting in the March 11 governorship and House of Assembly elections.
