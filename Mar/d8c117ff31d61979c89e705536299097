THE National Population Commission (NPC) has said the postponement of the 2023 gubernatorial and state house of assembly elections will affect the 2023 Housing and Population Census. The NPC chairman, Nasir Kwarra, disclosed this on Friday, March 10 at a meeting with the Resident Representative of the United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA), Ms Ulla Mueller, in Abuja. The national census — which will be holding hold after 17 years — has been scheduled for March 29 to April 2. The census was to hold two weeks after the governorship election, initially slated for March 11. However, INEC has moved the governorship and state assembly elections to March 18. Speaking on the development, the NPC chairman said he would have to consult with President Muhammadu Buhari on a suitable date for the national census to begin as no specific date had been assigned for it. He applauded the UNFPA for its support and partnership. “Over the years, the UNFPA’s partnership with the NPC has been invaluable in propelling the vision and mission of the Commission forward in its bid to strive for demographic excellence, a successful and fully digital 2023 PHC and, in turn, the 2023 PES. “Thus far, the Commission and the UNFPA have spared no expense in training and equipping the Commission’s ranks with the necessary tools, knowledge, and skills to undertake the 2023 PES in line with international best practices,” he said.
