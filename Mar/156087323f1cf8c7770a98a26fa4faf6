THE Nigeria Police Force (NPF) has warned citizens against bringing pets, especially dogs, to polling units on election day. According to the Police, bringing dogs to polling units is against the law, going by provisions of the 2022 amended Electoral Act. The Force Public Relations Officer Olumuyiwa Adejobi issued the warning in  statement released on Tuesday, February 7, via the Force Twitter handle. The Police spokesperson noted that the electoral law classified dogs as offensive weapons because some people take them to the polling units on election days to harass voters who are exercising their constitutional rights. He pointed out that the electoral act banned the possession of weapons calculated to intimidate voters at polling units. “The provision of Section 126 (1) of the Electoral Act 2022 explains clearly those actions exhibited by electorates that constitute electoral breaches and are punishable under the law, and paragraph (f) mentions possession of weapons calculated to intimidate voters and electoral officers. Dogs could be classed as offensive weapons as their owners/handlers can use them to intimidate, harass and cause assault and bodily harm to others. “The Dogs Act, CAP 55 Laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1958 as domesticated in various States, and other Criminal Laws in Nigeria are trite. “The conceived ideas and plans by certain individuals, electorates, and groups of people to go to the polls accompanied by pets are unacceptable, stand discouraged, and remain an act of electoral infraction as it will cause harassment and intimidation. “The Nigeria Police Force, therefore, warns those who intend to display their pets, dogs specifically, for whatever purpose, at the polling units, to desist as such constitutes a violation of the electoral Act, 2022, as amended, and other extant laws,” the statement said.
