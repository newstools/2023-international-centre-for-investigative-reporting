THE Zamfara State government has supported 300 point-of-sale (PoS) operators with N70 million to fast-track implementation of the cashless policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in the state. The Commissioner for Commerce and Industries in the state, Yazeed Danfulani, disclosed this on March 8 while distributing the PoS machines to 300 youths and women. Danfulani said the gesture was part of Governor Bello Matawalle’s empowerment and wealth creation programmes, adding that the PoS business would boost the cashless policy and make beneficiaries self-reliant. ”Each of the beneficiaries will receive a PoS machine, mobile shop, a set of plastic chairs and tables to attend to customers. ”Each beneficiary will equally receive N50,000 seed capital to start the PoS transaction,” he said, adding that about N70 million had been earmarked for the programme. According to him, the PoS business would boost the state economy and revenue base, as well as enhance wealth creation in the society. He said the government had set up a monitoring mechanism to ensure prudent use of the machines and other items given to the beneficiaries. The Commissioner urged the beneficiaries to ensure effective utilisation of the items and set up their businesses to enable them become self-reliant.
