THE West African Elders Forum (WAEF) has applauded Nigerians for their “resilience and patriotism” during the February 25 presidential and National Assembly elections, but cautioned politicians on taking actions that could jeopardise the collective stability and peace of the nation.
The Forum, in a statement jointly issued on Tuesday, February 28 by the Head of Mission to Nigeria 2023 and former President of the Republic of Ghana John Mahama, and the former president of Nigeria Goodluck Jonathan, called on all those who contested as presidential candidates, political parties and their supporters to maintain and embrace peace. It urged dissatisfied politicians to rather use all available constitutional means and methods to sort out their concerns and grievances. The statement read, “We hope to sustain this Mission until the electoral processes are successfully concluded. We, therefore, urge everyone to be circumspect in their actions and responsibilities during this moment in order not to jeopardize the collective stability and peace of the nation.”
