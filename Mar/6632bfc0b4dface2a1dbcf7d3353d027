THE Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it would punish negligent officials whose actions sabotaged the efficiency and transparency of the Saturday, February 25 presidential and National Assembly elections. Admitting that the elections were flawed, the commission said officials, including ad-hoc or collation personnel, found wanting in the conduct would be punished and prohibited from participating in the March 11 governorship and state House of Assembly elections. The INEC chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, disclosed this on Saturday, March 4, during a meeting with Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) in Abuja. According to him, the elections raised several issues that require immediate, medium and long-term solutions. Yakubu asked the resident commissioners to immediately initiate disciplinary action where prima facie evidence of wrongdoing had been established. He also told the RECs that election logistics must be finalised days before the election, noting that they would be held responsible for any delay or inefficiency caused by poor arrangements. “This has been our standard practice. Centralising the process as was done in some states resulted in a delayed deployment of personnel and materials, and in late commencement of polls. “RECs will be held responsible for any tardy arrangement or the failure to deploy electric power generators to collation centres or polling units where such facilities are needed. The Commission has enough facilities in all the states of the Federation. Failure to deploy them is simply inexcusable,” he said.
