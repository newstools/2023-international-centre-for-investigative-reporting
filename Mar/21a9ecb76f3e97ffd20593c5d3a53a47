The 40 years old said the notion that unemployed youths are lazy is wrong. Instead, according to him, the unemployed youths seek jobs to earn a decent living. “They want jobs, so we are going to ensure that we give them employability skills and domicile these skills at the local governments,” he said. The LP guber candidate further promised to make the city work for the good of all, noting that there is a need to end the ‘agbero’ system that has created a lot of safety hazards. He added that healthcare, education, transportation, clean pipe-borne water, and other infrastructure would work effectively under his administration.
