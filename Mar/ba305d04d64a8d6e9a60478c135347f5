THE Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Water Board has announced plans to cut off water supply across certain areas of the city for two days. This was disclosed in a statement released by the Water Board management on Thursday, March 9. The statement said the interruption was due to emergency maintenance that is to be carried out on trunk pipes. “The Management of FCT Water Board wishes to inform the General Public particularly residents of Apo, Gudu, Durumi, Gaduwa Estate, Prince & Princess Estate, Games Village, Galadimawa, Utako, Jahi, Life Camp and parts of Gwarimpa, that there will be disruption of normal water supply from Thursday, 9th March to Friday 10th March 2023. “This is to allow our Engineers carry out repair works on one of our trunk lines supplying the areas mentioned above. Normal water supply will be restored on Saturday 11th March 2023. The FCT Water Board apologises for any inconveniences during the duration of the repair works,” it read. Residents were warned to make adequate reservations ahead of the disruption. The board had carried out a similar 2-day maintenance exercise in January on the lower Usman Dam and warned residents in Maitama, Asokoro, Garki 1, Garki 2, Kubwa 1, Kubwa 2, Airport and Gwagwalada to make adequate preparations ahead.
