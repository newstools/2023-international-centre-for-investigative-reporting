THE governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos, Abdul-Azeez Adediran, often addressed as Jandor, says his victory in the state gubernatorial election is assured. Adeniran said this on Saturday February 4 while addressing a gathering of Igbo communities that endorsed him as their preferred candidate. According to him, the events of the February 25 presidential election were inconsequential to his chances of winning in Lagos. He said that after the election, Lagosians would “celebrate freedom from the ruling party, freedom from a government that looked aside as hoodlums attacked residents and traders in the state.” Said the governorship candidate, “By next week, we will be out of that government that will not let us breathe on the road and at marketplaces. That government that releases hoodlums to attack its citizens without condemning it for one day, their days are numbered. Next week, we will end their existence in Lagos. “Please, make no mistake, put out the votes; I am ready to protect them. They have been threatening. Jandor is prepared to deploy conventional and unconventional security for next Saturday’s elections. “Whatever happened at the centre is inconsequential. This is Lagos, and we are taking our Lagos back.”
