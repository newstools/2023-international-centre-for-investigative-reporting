THE controversy surrounding the just concluded Presidential and National Assembly Election in Nigeria has escalated with six state governments dragging the Federal Government to the Supreme Court over the conduct of the exercise. The six states – Adamawa, Akwa-Ibom, Bayelsa, Delta, Edo and Sokoto – have asked the Supreme Court to nullify the election. The states which are controlled by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) want the Supreme Court to rule that the declaration of the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, as the winner of the February 25 presidential election is null and void. They added that the whole results of the presidential election, as announced by the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood Yakubu, violate provisions of the Electoral Act. They further demanded a declaration that the refusal to upload the results of each of the 176,974 Polling Units nationwide, in respect of the Presidential and National Assembly Election, was not in accordance with the provisions of the Electoral Act. The ICIR reported that INEC on Wednesday, March 1, declared APC candidate, Tinubu, winner of the Saturday, February 25, presidential election. According to figures released by INEC, Tinubu polled 8,794,726 votes to defeat the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, who came second with 6,984,520 votes. Labour Party (LP) candidate Peter Obi came third with 6,101,533 votes, according to INEC’s official result.
