THE President-Elect, Bola Tinubu, has set up a reconciliation committee to meet with his major opponents in the presidential race, including Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP). This was disclosed by Ondo State governor Rotimi Akeredolu. He said the committee comprises elders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Akeredolu, who spoke on Wednesday, March 1, in Abuja during the presentation of the certificate of return to Tinubu and Kashim Shetima, vice president-elect, said the election was free and fair, and the votes of the electorate produced the President-Elect. He noted that every aggrieved person would be met for reconciliation. Akeredolu said Tinubu set up the committee to meet with other candidates and “start the healing process”. “I belong to one of the committees. We are going to meet them and appeal to them to work together. “This is an election that was not padded. People who voted were counted; that is the way I see it, not one which shows millions of votes. You can see the candidates; everyone won 12 states each. It has never been like that before.” He added: “Ondo people are progressives and we will always, at least, be on the side of progressivism. From the onset, we were at the forefront of clamour for a Southern President and so we had to put everything we had into it, and we got the support. That is why we can make it.”
