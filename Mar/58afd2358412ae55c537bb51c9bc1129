AFTER 16 years of suspension by the National Judicial Council (NJC), Justice Babajide Aladejana of Ekiti State High Court has been reinstated to office. Justice Aladejana was suspended in 2006 along with the stateâ€™s former Chief Judge, Justice Kayode Bamisile, for their alleged roles in the political crisis that led to the impeachment of the former governor of the state, Ayodele Fayose. The suspension came under the administration of the former Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) Justice Alfa Belgore. The allegations against Aladejana and Bamisile included abuse of office, illegal operation of a foreign account, and involvement in an alleged N1.4 billion poultry scandal. The suspension was lifted after a review by the NJC. According to Daily Trust, Justice Aladejana has officially resumed work, and he has been allocated High Court Number Two, where he will be hearing cases and performing other judicial functions.
