THE Appeal Court in Abuja has reserved judgment on the appeal filed by Ademola Adeleke challenging his sack as Osun State governor. The three-member panel of the appellate court, led by Justice M.F. Shuaibu, stated that a date will be communicated to all parties in the appeal after the hearing on Monday, March 13. Adeleke was represented by Onyechi Ikpeazu, SAN, while Lateef Fagbemi, SAN, represented Gboyega Oyetola. Adeleke is the appellant, while Gboyega Oyetola and the All Progressives Congress (APC) are the first and second respondents, respectively. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are also joined as the third and fourth respondents in the suit. The Osun Governorship Election Petition Tribunal had ruled in favour of Oyetola, the state’s former governor, on January 27. Two out of the three-member panel held that Oyetola was able to prove that there was over-voting in some of the polling units. Adeleke rejected the judgment, describing it as a miscarriage of justice and an unfair interpretation against the will of the majority of voters. In the 31 grounds of appeal, Adeleke is praying the court for “an order setting aside the whole decision of the tribunal”. He also seeks “an order striking out the petition for want of competence and jurisdiction or, in the alternative, an order dismissing the petition on the merit”. Adeleke submitted that the tribunal exhibited bias when it said “the second respondent (Adeleke) cannot ‘go lo lo lo lo’ and ‘buga won’ as the duly elected governor of Osun State”.
