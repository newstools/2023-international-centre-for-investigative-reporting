In the lead judgment handed down by Justice Adamu Jauro, the Supreme Court supported arguments made by Damian Dodo, the counsel for Lawal, that his client had been legitimately and lawfully nominated in accordance with the law. Justice Jauro upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal Sokoto, which had endorsed the candidate’s second primary election on January 6. A Federal High Court in Gusau, Zamfara State capital, had earlier nullified the primary election that produced Lawal. The judge, Justice Aminu Bappa-Aliyu, ruled that the PDP had no gubernatorial candidate in the state. However, the Sokoto Division of the Court of Appeal overturned the Federal High Court’s decision in its ruling on Friday, January 6, and directed INEC to accept Lawal as the PDP candidate for Zamfara governorship election.
