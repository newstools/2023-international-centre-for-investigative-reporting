THE Labour Party (LP) has announced plans to mobilise supporters and party members for a nationwide protest against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The party said it would protest if the electoral commission refused to comply with the court order that grants it access to the materials used for the conduct of the last presidential election. The party disclosed this in a statement issued by its spokesperson, Dr Yunusa Tanko, on Saturday, March 11. “The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) with greatest impunity have refused, neglected and failed to obey the Order of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja made on the 3rd day of March 2023, directing it to grant the Labour Party and its presidential candidate, HE. Peter Gregory Obi leave to apply and receive from INEC certified true copies of materials used in the presidential election on 25th February 2023. “It will be recalled that the aforesaid Order of the presidential election petition tribunal was duly served on INEC on the 3rd of March 2023 even though they were present and represented at the tribunal when the Order was made. “Not minding the service of the said Order on INEC, and a reminder letter dated the 6th day of March 2023 and delivered the same date at the INEC Headquarters Abuja, the electoral umpire has continued to ignore and or disobey the valid Order of such magnitude till now,” parts of the statement read. The party described INEC’s failure to comply with the court order as an act of judicial insubordination. “It should be noted that in a democracy like ours, the rule of law must triumph not only in our legal system but also in our body polity. “The action of INEC under reference also constitutes, for all intent and purposes, an act of judicial insubordination and willful refusal to comply with the court’s order,” the statement added.
