THE Labour Party (LP) National Chairman, Julius Abure, has dissolved the party’s State Executive Council in Rivers State due to alleged anti-party activities and corruption in the management of party funds. Abure’s statement, released on Tuesday, March 7, stated that the dissolution would take immediate effect. He added that those who were in charge of the party’s affairs in the state when its presidential mandate was stolen in the just concluded election should step down until a thorough investigation is carried out. Abure claimed that he had lost confidence in the ability of the compromised State Executive Council led by Deinye Pepple to lead the campaign for the governorship and State House of Assembly elections, scheduled to take place on March 11. He urged all party members in the state to disregard all comments and actions by Pepple. The LP national chairman also stressed that Beatrice Itubo remained the party candidate for Saturday’s governorship election in the state. According to him, the Labour Party had not formed any alliance with any other political party. Hours before Abure’s announcement, Pepple had endorsed the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers State, Siminialayi Fubara, for Saturday’s election. Pepple, in a communique jointly issued with some of the party’s leaders in the state, stated that the South-East Zone of Rivers, where Fubara hails from, has never had the opportunity to produce a governor, which they consider to be a violation of the values of equity and fairness. He urged the party’s supporters to vote for Fubara and LP candidates for state assembly positions.
