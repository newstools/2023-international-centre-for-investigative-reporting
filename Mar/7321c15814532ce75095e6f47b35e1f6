THE Labour Party (LP) has warned its members against uploading vital information on “fraudulent” election results on unrecognised platforms. The party issued the warning via its official Twitter handle-LabourPartyNG@NgLabour. “Be informed we have not requested that evidences of fraudulent results collated by INEC be sent via any online platform. We are careful to avoid mischievous people taking advantage of the process. Thanks,” the party tweeted.  Prior to this directive, an online portal had been opened with the picture of the LP presidential candidate, Peter Obi, and his wife, Margaret Obi, requesting for information about “fraudulent” election evidence against the party. Obi, who came third at the just concluded presidential election, had in a media briefing on March 2 said he would be approaching the court to reclaim his “stolen mandate.” The Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, has already granted separate ex-parte applications filed by Obi and the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Atiku Abubakar seeking permission to inspect the electoral materials used in the Saturday, February 25 presidential and National Assembly elections. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) officially declared the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, winner of the election on March 1, trailed by Abubakar and Obi respectively.
