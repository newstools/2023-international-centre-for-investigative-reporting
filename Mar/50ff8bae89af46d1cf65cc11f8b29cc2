THE Lagos State government has disclosed that the death toll in Thursday’s accident involving a train and a staff bus has risen to six. The ICIR reported how the BRT bus, which was conveying some staff members of the state government, collided with a train coming from Abeokuta in the PWD/Sogunle rail and got dragged to the PWD area of Ikeja. Two people were immediately confirmed dead. The Secretary of Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, said the bus driver disobeyed the traffic signal. According to Oke-Osanyintolu, the immediate cause of the incident was the bus driver’s reckless driving in which he tried to beat the train traffic signal before the train hit the vehicle. Meanwhile, Lagos State governor, Babjide Sanwo-Olu, in a swift response, expressed deep shock and sorrow over the unfortunate incident. Sanwo-Olu, later, declared a three-day mourning and directed flags to fly at half-mast and civil servants to work half day on Friday, Match 10. Also, the State Commissioner for Health, Akin Abayomi, in an update on Twitter on Friday, said additional four people died while receiving treatment at the hospital.   Abayomi said about 120 casualties recorded from the accident all sustained varying degrees of injuries, including life-threatening conditions such as head and chest cases. While adding that some of them have been admitted to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), he added that 25 patients with moderate injuries are receiving treatments in five General Hospitals in the state. He promised that further updates on the incident and medical condition of the victims will be provided as much as necessary.
