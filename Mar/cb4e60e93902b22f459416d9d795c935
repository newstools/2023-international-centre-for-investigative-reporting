THE Supreme Court has dismissed Ibrahim Shekarau as the senator-elect for Kano Central Senatorial District of Kano State. The apex court also ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to replace Shekarau with Rufai Hanga as the candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) for the district. Delivering the judgelment on Friday, March 10 in Abuja, a Supreme Court panel led by Justice Uwani Abba-Aji upheld the judgement of the Court of Appeal which directed INEC to recognise Hanga as the candidate. INEC had earlier declared, Shekarau winner of the 2023 Kano Central Senatorial election. According to the INEC returning officer, Tijjani Darma, Shekarau polled 456,787 votes to defeat the All Progressives Congress candidate, Alhaji Abdulkarim Zaura, who polled 168,677 votes. The incumbent senator, Shekarau who dumped New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) for the Peoples Democratic Party in August 2022 was still recognised as the legitimate candidate of the NNPP despite his replacement by the party. However, the apex court affirmed Hangaâ€™s nomination as the authentic candidate of the NNPP.
