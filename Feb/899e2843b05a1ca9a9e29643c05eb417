VOTERS at Polling Unit 048 in Dutse-Alhaji, in the Bwari area of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have insisted that results be uploaded electronically by officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) who conducted elections at the unit. The officials had announced that they were unable to upload the results to the INEC portal and cited network issues as the problem. “We cannot transmit the results, the link is not opening,” an official announced at about 7:50 pm. Angry voters, however, refused to release the officials until the results were electronically transmitted. Voters volunteered to provide alternative internet connections to the officials to no avail. “Call the office to supply a back up server for the uploading before all of us can leave here. We cannot be here by this time and you’ll say there is not network to upload the results,” an angry voter said. One of the NYSC members placed a call to a superior staff. He told voters he had been instructed by his superior to return to the Registration Area Centre (RAC). “They told us that if we cannot transmit it here we should go to the RAC. You people can follow us to the RAC,” the Presiding Officer said. As at the time of filing this report, voters were still at the PU 048, insisting on electronic transmission of the results. The Labour Party got the highest number of votes in the Presidential and National Assembly elections at the unit. The LP got 223 votes in the presidential polls, and 187 and 190 in the Senatorial and House of Representatives elections held at the unit. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) followed with 21 votes in the Presidential polls, 66 and 57 votes at the Senatorial and House of Representatives elections. The All Progressives Congress (APC) gathered 16 votes at the Presidential elections, and 15 and 17 in the Senatorial and House of Representatives elections held at the unit.
