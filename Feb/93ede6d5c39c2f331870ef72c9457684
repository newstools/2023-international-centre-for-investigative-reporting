SOME voters at Ozubulu in Ekwusigo Local Government Area of Anambra, volunteered as adhoc officials of the Independent National ElectoralÂ Commission (INEC) failed to report for election duty. The volunteers took the place of the adhoc staff to ensure that voting took place at polling units 006, 007 and 008 at Uruokwe Central School in Ozubulu, Ekwusigo LGA. Reports had it that some NYSC members earlier trained and deployed for election duties at the polling units did not show up on Saturday. Only the presiding officers who were not corps members reported for duty making some voters to volunteer to serve as adhoc officials. The development posed a challenge as the volunteers were untrained and had difficulties handling the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) and following laid down procedure for the exercise. It was the same situation at polling units 018 and 019,in Umuanyiegbu Hall, Ward 004, Ozubulu, Ekwusigo LGA. The presiding officers refused to talk with journalists and efforts to get the Resident Electoral Commissioner, INEC, Elizabeth Agwu, to react to the development proved abortive.
