THE Lagos State Police Command has dispelled the rumour that some thugs attacked traders of the Igbo stock, destroying their shops and properties in the state. In a series of tweets posted through his Twitter handle, the state command spokesperson, Benjamin Hundeyin, said the claim that thugs attacked Igbo traders in Mandilas market, Lagos Island is false. According to him, the traders generally in the market had agreed to stay away from trading there for two days, and the thugs were present to enforce compliance. However, the police arrived promptly and sent out the thugs before they could wreak any havoc. Hundeyin described the claim as fake news, saying, “The market association agreed that shops would remain closed yesterday and today. Igbo traders this morning decided to renege on the agreement and open shop. “Some hoodlums took it upon themselves to enforce compliance. The police were alerted. The police arrived promptly. The hoodlums fled upon sighting police patrol vans. Not one shop was vandalised. Not one person was robbed. Not one person was injured. Normalcy was swiftly returned, and officers remain on ground.” The state police also urged Nigeria to “shun fake news.” In the past, there had been reports of thugs attacking traders nationwide. In June, thugs reportedly attacked Lagos residents who gathered for voter registration in Ojo local government area of the state. Also, in 2019, thugs attacked traders at Okhuahe community in Uhunmwode LGA, Edo State.
