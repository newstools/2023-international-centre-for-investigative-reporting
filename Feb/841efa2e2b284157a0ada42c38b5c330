VIOLENT protests have erupted in various parts of Lagos due to the scarcity of naira notes, leaving commuters stranded and causing traffic congestion. The ICIR observed that the protests began in the Ojota area of Lagos1 and spread to other areas such as Maryland, Ketu, Mile 12, and some parts of the Ikorodu area in the early hours of Friday, February 17. As the protests escalated, commuters were targeted by the protesters, and reports suggest that some individuals were attacked. Bonfires were also set on major roads, causing panic among residents and commuters. Pictures and videos of the protests have been widely circulated on the social media, showing scenes of chaos and confusion in the affected areas. Residents and commuters are shown running for safety, while protesters can be seen blocking roads and burning tyres. The situation has caused widespread concern among residents, who are calling for an end to the protests and a resolution to the underlying issue of currency shortages. The Lagos State Police Command has mobilised officers to the affected areas in an attempt to restore peace and order. According to the State Police spokesperson, Benjamin Hundeyin, law enforcement personnel have been working to clear the roads and ensure that free movement of vehicles is restored. The ongoing currency shortages in the country have caused widespread frustration and hardship for many people, with some individuals struggling to access cash to make ends meet. The scarcity has had a negative impact on the Nigerian economy, affecting both businesses and individuals. It has also led to a rise in the cost of goods and services, making it difficult for people to afford basic necessities.
