KANO State governor Abdullahi Ganduje has said some opposition political parties are seeking to disrupt the democratic transition while hiding behind the naira redesign policy introduced by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The governor made the claim in a statement issued by the state Commissioner for Information, Mallam Muhammad Garba. Reacting to the suit filed by four political parties seeking non-extension of the deadline for withdrawing old naira notes from circulation, Ganduje accused the parties of secretly working with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to sabotage the country’s democracy.
