SENATE President Ahmed Lawan has been declared winner of the Yobe North Senatorial District by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The result was announced by the returning officer Yobe North Professor Omolola Aduloje from the Federal University Gashua, Bade Local Government. According to the returning officer, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) polled 91,318 votes to defeat Ilu Alhaji-Bello of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who got 22,849 votes. She therefore declared Lawan as winner of Yobe North Senatorial Election. Questions were raised after Lawan, who did not participate in the Yobe North senatorial primary, was nominated for the seat by the APC after he lost the presidential ticket. He emerged the APC senatorial candidate through a Supreme Court ruling, after a running battle with Bashir Machina, who won the partyâ€™s primary election.
