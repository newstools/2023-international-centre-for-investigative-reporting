THE presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) for the 2023 elections, Peter Obi, has urged Nigerians to salvage their country, which he said had suffered enough. Obi made the call at a book launched in his honour on Tuesday, February 7, in Abuja. The book “Peter Obi: Many Voices, One Perspective” explored the life and ideals of the former Anambra State governor.

Nigeria has suffered enough. This is a great country that can be turned around. We can’t succeed without your intervention.” Describing the upcoming presidential poll as “an existential election”, Obi warned that if the nation got its leadership choice wrong at the poll, the aftermath would be unpredictable. He urged the citizens to give him their votes to enable him to offer the good leadership they desired. The book launchers used the platform to raise money for the candidate’s campaign. When filing this report at the event venue, the organizers raised less than N50 million. Influential personalities from the South-East, including actor and lawyer Kenneth Okonkwo and Peter Okoye, popularly known as P-Square, dominated the event. The ICIR reports that Peter Obi is among the four leading presidential candidates in the coming election. He is contesting against the All Progressives Congress (APC) Bola Tinubu, Peoples’ Democratic Party’s Atiku Abubakar, New Nigeria’s Peoples Party (NNPP) Rabiu Kwankwaso and other nearly other dozen candidates.
