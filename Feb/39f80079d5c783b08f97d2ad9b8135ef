CLAIM: Reno Omokri posted a graphic on his Instagram page claiming the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, is leading with 25 per cent in 25 states. THE FINDINGS: INEC is yet to post conclusive results on the presidential elections. INEC’s National Commissioner, Festus Okoye, told Channels TV at 3:45 pm on Sunday, February 26, 2023 that the electoral body will announce the full presidential election results at the national collation centre in Abuja. VERDICT: MISLEADING SOURCES: INEC, Channels TV CLAIM: A Twitter user, Quinn (@Quinn_Tweets), shared an image showing the Labour Party is leading the polls by 36 per cent, followed by the PDP by 27 per cent and the APC by 24 per cent. THE FINDINGS: A reverse image search shows it is a screenshot of an opinion poll conducted on January 27, 2023, by Nextier. The viral image was shared after cropping parts showing it is a pre-election poll. The poll was shared by Nextier on Twitter on February 5, 2023. Figures from INEC’s Result Viewing Portal (IReV) show otherwise. VERDICT: INCORRECT SOURCE: Nextier CLAIM: An online post claims that the Labour Party (LP) has called for the cancellation of the ongoing presidential election as INEC cannot upload results from the polling units into its server. THE FINDINGS: LP, in a press release on its website, condemned the delay, but the party did not seek cancellation of the results. VERDICT: INCORRECT SOURCE: Labour Party’s website. CLAIM: A Twitter account, PDP New Media (PDP_NEWMEDIA) claimed that the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abuubakar, has secured 25% in about 25 states. THE FINDINGS: There has not been an official announcement of results by INEC at the national collation centre in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital. At state level, only results from Ekiti State have been announced so far as of 2.15p.m. when this fact check was filed. VERDICT: INCORRECT SOURCES: Media reports CLAIM:  There have been viral claims that  a Labour Party Chieftain, Pat Utomi, was held hostage by thugs at a collation centre in Victoria Island, Lagos state. THE FINDINGS:  Labour party spokesperson, Yunusa Tanko, has debunked the claim. Similarly, PPRO Police State Command, Benjamin Hundeyin,  told the NFC that he is unaware of the situation. Pat Utomi also confirmed that “he is fine” and described the claim as false. VERDICT: INCORRECT SOURCE: Pat Utomi, Yunusa Tanko, Benjamin Hundeyin CLAIM:  A viral report claimed operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) stormed the residence of Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), during the elections. THE FINDINGS: When contacted, Wilson Uwajuren, the spokesperson of the EFCC, told the NFC that the agency only deployed officials to the polling stations to monitor the elections and did not visit the house of any candidate. Also, Labour Party spokesperson, Yunusa Tanko, debunked the claim. We also found that the photo was that of EFCC officials’ visit to Ward C, PU 085 Alausa, Ikeja, on Saturday. VERDICT: INCORRECT. SOURCE: EFCC’s spokesperson, LP PCC spokesperson, Media report. CLAIM: A Twitter parody account with the name Niyi Akinsiju and the username @Agbaakinlmodoye claimed APC has won four local government areas in Lagos state. THE FINDINGS: A check on the INEC IReV portal by the NFC shows that the results posted by Akinsiju were misleading as the electoral body is yet to collate results for all the Wards/RA in the mentioned local government areas: Alimosho; Ikeja; Ajeromi-Ifelodun and Amuwo Odofin. VERDICT: MISLEADING. SOURCE: INEC IReV portal, Media Observer. CLAIM: A viral claim circulated by social media users on WhatsApp and Twitter claims that INEC has extended elections in 16 states. THE FINDINGS: Rotimi Oyekanmi, Chief Press Secretary to the INEC chairman clarified that the news is not from the commission. Additionally, INEC’s national chairman on voter’s education, Festus Okoye, debunked the news as fake. He stated that “INEC did not extend the voting period in 16 States. The narrative is fake and the public should disregard it entirely.” VERDICT: INCORRECT SOURCE: INEC CLAIM: A claim circulates on WhatsApp with results that APC and PDP are leading in  Kwara, Ekiti, Osun, Ogun and Oyo states with 6,111,796 and 4,367,845, respectively. THE FINDINGS: Results in the aforementioned states are still being collated, and the final results are yet to be announced as of 11.25a.m. of Sunday, February 26, 2023. Also, updates from multiple news platforms did not support this claim. VERDICT:  MISLEADING. SOURCE: Multiple news sources CLAIM:  A Twitter user, Comrade Moh (@I_Am_marwa), claims Senator Datti Baba-Ahmed, Labour Party’s VP candidate, was voted only by his wife and children at his polling unit. THE FINDINGS: The Labour Party’s VP polling unit is 021 at Tudun Wada ward in Zaria Local Government Area of Kaduna State. Based on reports by the Punch Newspaper and TheCable, there were 272 accredited voters at the polling unit. PDP won the polling unit with 102 votes, followed by the APC with 98 votes, while LP came third with 54 votes, and the NNPP secured 11 votes. VERDICT: INCORRECT. SOURCE: Punch and TheCable Newspapers CLAIM: An APC supporter with the Twitter username @Tinubufrontier claimed Bola Tinubu had won about seven local government areas in Yobe State. THE FINDINGS: Anna Charles, a media observer affiliated with the Centre for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID), told the NFC that the results bandied around on social media were false as official results had yet to be compiled at the collation centre. VERDICT: INCORRECT. SOURCE: CJID Observer CLAIM: An APC supporter with the Twitter username @DOlusegun claimed TheCable’s report on LP performance at Gbajabiamila’s polling unit is false. THE FINDINGS: Our findings showed that the result uploaded by TheCable Newspaper is for the presidential election in which the Labour Party polled 89 as against the APC’s 69. A journalist affiliated with the Center for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID) confirmed this to the NFC. The social media user mistook it for the result of the Senatorial election, where the APC topped the chart. VERDICT: MISLEADING.
