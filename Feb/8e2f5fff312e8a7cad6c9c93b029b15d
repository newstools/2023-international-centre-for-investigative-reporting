THE presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, has suggested measures the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) should take to end the crisis trailing the scarcity of new naira notes. In a statement he signed on Sunday, February 12, Tinubu said he was not opposed to the currency swap, but to the pains it brought to Nigerians. He commended the National Council of State, which recommended on Friday, February 10, that the CBN print more notes or redistribute the old notes in its coffers. Tinubu, a former Lagos State governor, rued the agonies Nigerians have faced since the use of the new naira notes took effect on December 15, 2022. He expressed delight that the petrol motor spirit (PMS) is becoming more available at fuel stations. The ICIR reports that fuel and currency scarcity have led to protests in some parts of the country in the past few days and threatened the 2023 general elections, which begin on February 25 with the presidential and National Assembly elections. While many Nigerians have said the currency swap is ill-timed, others believe making the old notes cease from being legal tender will prevent persons who have kept large funds in vaults for vote buying from using them. “For the records, I and my running mate, Senator Kashim Shettima and our campaign council do not have anything against the CBN Naira redesign and cashless policy in principle. “We are, however, only concerned about its disruptive implementation and the hardship it has brought on the generality of our people who currently can’t access their hard-earned money to meet obligations and the attendant consequences on the informal sector, where majority operate,” Tinubu said. The ICIR reports that Tinubu had said the currency swap and fuel scarcity were targeted at him to make him fail the election. In his Sunday statement, he recommended the following for the CBN to alleviate the currency crisis.
