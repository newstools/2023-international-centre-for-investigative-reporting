THE Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has postponed the collation of the presidential election results till 11am on Monday. The INEC chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, announced this today at the National Collation Centre, Abuja. According to Yakubu, only one state had concluded the collation of its results. He said the results of the remaining states were on their way to Abuja. The ICIR had reported that the commission had disclosed that the collation of presidential results opened early today. Yakubu said that the collation of election results would commence immediately after the scores of each state begin to arrive. “From today the collation centre is hereby declared open until the final determination of the 2023 presidential election. During the proceeding, there may be an interlude or adjournment. This will be announced by the returning officer as the need arises. “As soon as any of the scores arise, the collation will begin. Once the processes begin, the collation centre will be open all day and all night subject only to short breaks as may be announced by the returning officer,” he said. The ICIR, however, gathered that Ekiti is the only state with sorted results. The presidential election, which held yesterday across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, were contested by 18 political parties. Data from INEC showed that 87,209,007 of registered voters collected their PVCs and participated in the election. The figure translates to 93.3 per cent of total number of registered voters, which is 93,469,008.
