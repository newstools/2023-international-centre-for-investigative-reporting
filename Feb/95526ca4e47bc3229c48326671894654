THE Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has started the distribution of sensitive election materials to the 20 Local Government Areas in Lagos State. The State police spokesperson, Benjamin Hundeyin, confirmed this on Twitter on Wednesday, February 22. Hundeyin said that the distribution process was closely being monitored by the State Commissioner of Police, Idowu Owohunwa.  The Presidential and National Assembly elections are scheduled to take place on February 25, 2023. The presidential election, scheduled for Saturday, is an eagerly anticipated event as many Nigerians hope it would produce new leaders who can tackle the country’s pressing issues like insecurity, poverty, unemployment, and inflation. Nigeria’s large population and position as the largest economy in Africa make the election significant for the country and the region as a whole. The new president will face the daunting task of addressing these issues, which will require a comprehensive approach involving the government, private sector, civil society, and the citizens themselves. For instance, tackling poverty and unemployment will require creating jobs, empowering small businesses, and investing in education and skills development. Similarly, tackling insecurity will require addressing the root causes of the conflicts, building strong institutions, and promoting peace and reconciliation. Many Nigerians are hopeful their votes would count for the candidates of the choice, and INEC itself had promised to deliver a free and credible poll. Also, the outgoing Muhammadu Buhari administration had assured that security would be provided so that Nigerians can freely exercise their voting rights without any fear of intimidation.
