SECURITY operatives in Cross Rivers State have arrested a lecturer in the Philosophy Department of the University of Calabar, Gabriel Agabi, for being in possession of 17 Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machines. According to the News Agency Of Nigeria (NAN), Agabi, who was arrested on Sunday, February 26, was also accused of impersonating the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) collation officer for the Yache ward in Yala Local Government Area of the state Dominic Abakedi. Agabi was wearing a reflective jacket of INEC when he was arrested. He was reportedly picked up at the collation centre in Okpoma, with BVAS machinesÂ not programmed for the ward where he was arrested. Reports say Agabi was later taken to the Ogoja INEC office, where he confessed to having impersonated Abakedi and was later taken away by the police to the Ogoja Area Command for further investigation by the CID unit. According to NAN, the Commissioner of Police in charge of elections in the region, Zannah Shettima, refused to comment on the matter.
