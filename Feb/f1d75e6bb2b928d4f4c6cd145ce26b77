This page is constantly being updated with verified checks. Here are the live-checks: CLAIM: A one-minute and 38 seconds TikTok video circulating on WhatsApp claims that “Ekiti election 2023 is fake results.” THE FINDINGS: The original video, which is 22 minutes long, was posted on YouTube nearly eight years ago, precisely on March 31, 2015.  It shows the moment a former minister of Niger Delta, Godsday Orubebe, who was an agent of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) disrupted the national collation and announcement of the 2015 presidential election results on the same day the video was posted online. VERDICT: INCORRECT SOURCES: YouTube, Premium Times, Punch newspaper CLAIM: Social media users claimed that Peter Obi, the Labour Party’s (LP) presidential candidate, has polled over 1 million votes in Plateau State. THE FINDINGS: The result is yet to be announced officially by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as of 2.30 p.m. on Monday, February 27, when this report was filed. However, TheCable’s report on votes polled in Plateau State showed that  Obi had so far won eight LGAs while PDP won 2 LGAs out of the 17 LGAs in the state. In total, the LP presidential candidate polled 301,905 votes in Plateau state. VERDICT: MISLEADING. SOURCE: TheCable Newspaper CLAIM: A post shared on Facebook claimed that thugs have set fire to shops owned by Igbo traders in Ladipo market in Lagos. The post has also been circulated on WhatsApp. THE FINDINGS:  Checks showed that the video was from a 2022 fire incident in the market. Nosa Okunbor, the public relations officer of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), also said he has not received a report of any fire incident in the market as of Monday, February 27, 2023. VERDICT: INCORRECT SOURCES: LASEMA, Google reverse image search CLAIM: A Twitter user, @NajibHaruna_, claimed that Ibrahim Bello Muhammad, 27, the newly elected House of Reps member in Kebbi State is the youngest federal lawmaker in Nigeria’s history. THE FINDINGS: Findings show that Gabriel Saleh Zock of the APC, a first-term member representing Kachial/Kagarko Federal Constituency of Kaduna State is currently the youngest lawmaker in the House of Representatives. Gabriel was born on November 20, 1985. He became a lawmaker at the age of 34. If Bello is sworn in, he would break the record. VERDICT: CORRECT SOURCES: Multiple media reports CLAIM: Social media users say the image uploaded on INEC’s IReV for Ekiti polling unit, not the result sheet. THE FINDINGS: NFC’s visit to the INEC IReV portal confirms the report to be true. The image uploaded on the portal, as of 10am on Monday, February 27, differed from the INEC result sheet for the polling unit with code 13/01/02/001 under Ado ‘B’ Inisa Ward/RA in Ado Ekiti local government area. It rather contained the image of a young lady in a room. VERDICT: CORRECT SOURCE: INEC IReV Portal CLAIM: Bashir Ahmad, Special Assistant on Digital Communications to Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, on his Twitter handle, claims that APC has won the elections in 14 states, PDP in 7, LP in 4 and NNPP in 1. THE FINDINGS:  Reports by credible media platforms such as Channels TV and Premium Times reveal that INEC has declared the results of only one state, Ekiti, out of the 36 States in Nigeria as of 9am on Monday. VERDICT: INCORRECT SOURCES: Channels TV, Premium Times CLAIM: The headline of a news report on ejesgist.ng claims that the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, defeated the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Bola Tinubu, to win all 20 local government areas in Osun State. THE FINDINGS: Osun State has 30 local government areas. INEC result viewing portal shows that polling unit results of the 2023 presidential election have been uploaded from all 30 local government areas. The results declared at the national collation centre show that Atiku won 20 local governments while Tinubu won the remaining 10 LGAs. VERDICT: MISLEADING SOURCES: INEC IRev portal, Multiple media reports CLAIM: A Twitter user @drpenking tweeted an image that showed the Labour Party got 29,568 votes in Agege and claimed INEC switched the results to APC and reduced the numbers for Labour Party to 13,270. THE FINDINGS: Updates from various news outlets shows that APC won the Labour Party by a landslide in Agege local government area. We collated the results for each party and found that APC actually had 29,568 votes while Labour Party had a lesser total number of votes. VERDICT:  INCORRECT SOURCES: Multiple media reports CLAIM: Peoples Gazette headline reads that soldiers shoot ‘Oluomo’ dead at collation centre. THE FINDINGS: From the comment section, the NFC observed that some social media users were curious about which Oluomo was actually killed. Although the report states that PDP supporter Akinlabi Akinnaso, also known as Oluomo, was shot dead, reactions from commenters indicate confusion, prompting our check. The deceased is not the popular Lagos State NURTW chairman, MC Oluomo. VERDICT: MISLEADING.
