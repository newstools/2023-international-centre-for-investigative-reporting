While emphasising that the reports were fake, Osuntokun also said that of all the names purportedly listed as members that defected to the APC were not known to the party in the zone. He expressed concerns that people choose to accept false news on face value, saying that the press should not encourage misinformation. Osuntokun also expressed concerns about the fact that the report claimed that the leader of the defectors was the chairman of the LP in the South-West zone. According to Osuntokun, that the title was unknown to the party. He stressed that the party only had Zonal Coordinators of the Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), and there was nothing like Chairman LP South-West. He added that the partyâ€™s Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) was being impersonated with fictitious press releases in its name. According to Osuntokun, one of the fake press releases, purportedly signed by him, had him engaging in personal attacks on Lagosians. Describing the press release as total fabrication, he lamented that some people had even started abusing him before hearing his side of the story. Osuntokun said attacks on the party have shown the importance of LP in the presidential race.
