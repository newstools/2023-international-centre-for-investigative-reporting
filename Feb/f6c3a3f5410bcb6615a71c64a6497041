According to the transport union’s secretary, the coordinators are to organise drivers for the exercise. Kabiru also listed names and contact details of all its officials who would facilitate the successful deployment of vehicles and monitor the prompt delivery of election materials and personnel in all states across the country. The letter reads: “I am pleased to inform your good self that the Union’s leadership has appointed coordinators to be responsible for monitoring and supervision of the activities of our members to be engaged by the commission for its electoral activities at state and local government levels. “To achieve effective and efficient delivery of logistics, those engaged are to facilitate the successful deployment of vehicles as well as to monitor and assist the state councils they are assigned to. “They are also required to lead a delegation of state officials to supervise the signing of any contractual agreement with INEC in respect of the 2023 general elections.” INEC National Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, had on January 31, signed an MoU with the leadership of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) and the Road Transport Employees Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) on the transportation of election officials and ballot papers to polling units on the election day.
