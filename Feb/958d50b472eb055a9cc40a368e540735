The president, Petroleum Products Retail Outlets Owners Association of Nigeria (PETROAN), Prince Billy Harry, saw the increase in prices of petroleum products as gradually reflecting current global pricing realities. Harry said, “There’s a gradual shift to full deregulation with gradual price hike, which I believe the government would effect once the nation’s refineries become fully operational.” He noted that deregulation would enable market forces determine the real price of fuel and give marketers a competitive edge to be in business. Last week, The ICIR made a survey check on the average price of petrol across the country and discovered that logistic concerns and third party purchases by marketers were still major factors influencing prices across the country.
