NINE-YEAR-OLD David Balogun who made history as one of the youngest-ever high school graduates, has already finished a semester at Bucks County Community College, Pennsylvania, United States, The Guardian has reported. David lives with his family in Pennsylvania, US. The only person on that list younger than David is Michael Kearney, who still holds the Guinness world record for youngest high school graduate that he set when he was six in 1990, before obtaining master’s degrees at ages 14 and 18 years. David’s science teacher, Cody Derr, remarked: “David was an inspirational kid, definitely one who changes the way you think about teaching.” The young Balogun began high school just before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 at Reach Cyber Charter School and graduated with an over 4.0 GPA before the end of 2022. His mother, Ronya Balogun, said he was tested for giftedness in Grade 1 and later skipped several grades in elementary school when it was discovered he had the brain capacity to understand and comprehend a lot of concepts beyond his years and sometimes beyond her understanding. David, who is already a member of Mensa, the largest high-IQ society in the world, has a particular interest in science and computer programming and wants to be an astrophysicist who studies black holes and supernovas in the future. He also plays sports and the piano and is working on his martial arts black belt. His parents who both have advanced degrees admitted that raising a young son with extraordinary intellectual gifts was challenging.
