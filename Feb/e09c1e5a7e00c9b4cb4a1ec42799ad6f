FOUR Nigerians charged with criminal intimidation, rioting, assault, and use of criminal force to deter public servants from discharging their duties during the infamous rioting incident of October 2013 in India have been acquitted. The Nigerian men – Sunday Onye Lucky, Mwachukwu Elgwedimme, Arinze Ukemoezie and Ifeanyi Pascal – had gathered to view the body of another Nigerian, 35-year-old Simeon Obodo, who was murdered on the street in Gao village on October 30. Obodo’s death sparked a diplomatic row between both countries, as about 200 Nigerians in India staged a protest, blocking a national highway and clashing with locals and police in the area. Fifty-three of the protesting Nigerians were arrested, and while 49 of them were later released after meeting their bail conditions, the four were charged to court. However, a Mapusa court acquitted the four men after the prosecutor failed to provide evidence of their involvement in the crime. “No evidence has come on record that they used any force against police officials, nor has any specific act been attributed to any of the accused herein,” the court said. It added, “All this gives a presumption that the accused persons/Nigerians had gathered  to see the body of Obodo Uzona Simeon, the Nigerian national, and it cannot be said that their assembly was unlawful.” In addition, although photographers were present at the spot, no photographs were produced on the presence of the accused, the scene of the offence, or the body. The court also noted that police personnel from police stations other than Mapusa were called to Lobo Waddo, Parra, to control law and order situation, but that none of them was examined in support of the prosecution.
