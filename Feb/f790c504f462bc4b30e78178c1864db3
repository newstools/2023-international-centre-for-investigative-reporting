AHEAD of the 2023 general elections, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has urged political parties and candidates to accept results of the polls “in good faith”. In a press statement issued on Friday, February 10, CAN President Daniel Okoh said accepting the results would be in the best interest of Nigerians and the unity of the country. “We must see the elections as a time of peaceful transition of leadership and not war. Consequently, there’s need for all and sundry to put away religious  and ethnic bigotry and allow the will of God to prevail,” Okoh said. Okoh also charged the security agencies to be neutral in discharge of duties during the polls. “CAN calls on the authorities to beef up security, especially in communities vulnerable to attacks and ensure that no citizen is disenfranchised owing to precarious security situation in parts of the country.” The apex Christian body in the country also called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct free, fair and credible elections, noting that the Commission has no reason to fail. “Four years is enough time to have perfected the process and eliminated the glitches that featured in past polls,” the CAN President added.
