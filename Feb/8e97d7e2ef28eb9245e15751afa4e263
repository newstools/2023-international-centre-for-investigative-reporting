His kidnappers later called the victim’s wife and directed her to send the money to an account number sent to her by them. Akinnbinu, the victim’s wife, out of fear, invited the Amotekun Corps and other villagers to go along with her, but on arriving at the scene, the kidnappers were not there, and neither was the victim. The farmer’s lifeless body was found four days later inside the farm, with a chemical spray suspected to be acid. The State Police Public Relations Officer, Funmilayo Odunlami, who confirmed the incident, stated that the Command has commenced investigations into the matter.
