CHAIRMAN of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Yakubu Mahmoud, has said electoral processes in Esan and Igueben Federal Constituency of Edo State have been suspended. The INEC chairman made this known during a press briefing on ongoing 2023 general elections on Saturday in Abuja. He said the election in Esan North, Esan South and Igueben Local Government Area was suspended due to printing errors and omission of some crucial political parties’ logos. “In Edo State, we had a situation that we handled yesterday. One of the parties whose acronyms are on the result sheet but the logo is not on paper in a federal constituency after meeting with the stakeholders. “The decision was taken seems the materials are intact so we have suspended the election for Esan North, Esan South and Igueben the ballot papers should be reprinted and the election would now hold with the State constituency election on the 11th of March.” The INEC boss said the election in the local council has been postponed till Saturday, March 11. He reiterated his commitment towards achieving a free, fair and credible election. “We are determined that no Nigerian would or should be disenfranchised.” The INEC chairman also spoke on the attack by Boko Haram in Gwoza, Borno State. “The military has confirmed that it is an eighty-one-millimetre attack on two facilities including a filing station near INEC office but no damage to any facility nor casualties or disruption of the electoral process. “I reported earlier that we continue to lose some devices in Delta and Katsina and in Anambra state but we have recovered from these losses because we have contingency arrangements to respond to such attacks,” he added.
