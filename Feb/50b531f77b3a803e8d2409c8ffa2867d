HOURS after popular pro-Biafra separatist agitator Simon Ekpa was released following an invitation for questioning by Police in Finland, he has resumed threats that there would be no election in Nigeria’s South-East on Saturday, February 25. Ekpa, who was seen leaving his apartment in Lahti Thursday afternoon in company of plainclothes Finnish policemen, was later released. An officer at the Finnish Central Criminal Police Tommi Reen, had disclosed that Ekpa’s arrest was in connection with the ongoing preliminary investigation. One local journalist confirmed to the BBC that Ekpa was released after being interrogated for a couple of hours. Tweeting after his release, Ekpa wrote: “Tomorrow (Friday) sit at home, there will be no goat in the street…The end of Nigeria is here. your plan to islamise Nigeria using your terrorist group has failed. This Saturday, we will know who are the indigenous people”. Meanwhile, the South-East Council of Traditional Rulers has urged all residents of the South-East to ignore any sit-at-home order and massively go out to vote for their preferred candidates. The Nigerian government is worried over Ekpa’s inciting comments which could potentially scuttle the Presidential and National Assembly elections scheduled to hold on Saturday.
