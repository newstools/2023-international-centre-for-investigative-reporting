THE Lagos State Police Command has commenced investigation to unravel the circumstances surrounding the death of Whitney Adeniran, a 12-year-old student of Chrisland School, Ikeja, Lagos. Spokesperson of the Lagos State Police Command  Benjamin Hundeyin disclosed this on Monday, February 13. He said the Pen Cinema Police Division in Agege is handling the preliminary investigation, while the Homicide Section of the State Central Investigation Department, Panti, will take over the case for discreet investigation. The state government has ordered the closure of the school pending the conclusion of the investigation. The Commissioner for Education in Lagos, Folasade Adefisayo, issued a statement assuring the public that no effort will be spared in investigating the incident. She also expressed her condolences to Whitney’s family, friends, and acquaintances and called for calm. Whitney Adeniran, a student at Chrisland School’s Opebi branch in Ikeja, reportedly died during a sporting event at Agege Stadium on Thursday, February 9. The parents of the deceased have accused the school of negligence, claiming that no provision was made for emergency response at the event, which resulted in their daughter not receiving first aid at the scene of the incident. They dismissed the school’s claim that Whitney died from a cardiac arrest. According to them, their daughter had no pre-existing heart condition. Rather, the parents claimed their daughter was electrocuted. The management of Chrisland School issued a statement on the incident, claiming that Whitney had reported “not-too-buoyant” health on January 20. The school said it opted to take her to a health center, not a hospital, based on proximity considerations. The school dismissed any suggestions of foul play in Whitney’s death and said she slumped in public. The school claimed that the nearest medical facility was identified and the doctor on duty administered oxygen and every possible aid to Whitney.
