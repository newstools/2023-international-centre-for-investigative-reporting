Following attacks on banks by protesters over the naira scarcity crisis, the Association of Senior Staff of Banks, Insurance, and Financial Institutions (ASSBIFI) has directed its members in states where banks are being attacked to stay away from work. The ASSBIFI president, Olusoji Oluwole, gave the directive today in Lagos in a letter to the association’s unit presidents and secretaries. Oluwole stated in the directive that the stay-at-home order would subsist until normalcy was restored. “The national secretariat has been inundated with reports of threats and attacks on lives and properties of members and bank branches, and subsequently has been on the field to monitor and confirm the reports. “We issued warnings and appeals to government to provide security measures for the safety of lives and properties of our members within and around bank premises,” he stated. He regretted that the attacks had, however, continued without any form of security for the safety of  members, adding, “the recent being the attack on February 17 on one bank branch at Epe, Lagos State.” Oluwole pointed out that the lives and properties of members were being exposed to danger as a result of the attacks. He told members they would be given further directives as events unfold.
