THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC Rights and Accountability Project has asked United States (US) President Joe Biden to impose visa ban on sponsors and perpetrators of violence during the 2023 general elections. In a letter signed by the Deputy Director of SERAP, Kolawole Oluwadare, the group urged the US President to revoke the visas of anyone suspected to be responsible for intimidation, harassment and violation of voters during the elections. The letter dated February 25 also urged the US to freeze the assets and properties of perpetrators of electoral violence. SERAP made the call following reports of attacks, intimidation, harassment of voters and other forms of violence during the Saturday’s elections in several states of the country, including in Akwa Ibom, Enugu, Gombe, Lagos, Edo, Ogun, Osun, Rivers, and Taraba and the FCT. “The imposition of targeted sanctions against suspected perpetrators and sponsors of election-related violence in Nigeria would promote accountability, end impunity, and deter human rights violations. “The recommended travel bans, asset freezes and property sanctions should also cover anyone who may perpetrate and sponsor violence and human rights crimes during the postponed elections in 141 polling units, and the governorship elections scheduled for March 2023. “SERAP welcomes your government’s publicly expressed commitment to impose visa restrictions on officials, politicians and other perpetrators and sponsors of election-related intimidation, harassment, and violence. We urge you to include asset freezes and property sanctions on the list.
