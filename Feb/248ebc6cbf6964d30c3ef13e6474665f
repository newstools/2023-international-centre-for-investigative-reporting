THE Rivers State Collation Officer for the Presidential Election, Charles Adias, has adjourned the collation of results. Adias, the Vice Chancellor of the Federal University, Otueke, announced the adjournment on Tuesday morning while addressing journalists at the State Collation Centre in Port Harcourt. He said the adjournment was due to an alleged threat to his life by unnamed party supporters. The collation officer was asked by the Commissioner of Police in charge of the Presidential Election in the state, Aderemi Adeoye, to reveal the identity of those threatening his life. Adias refused and insisted that he will proceed once the stateâ€™s Resident Electoral Commissioner addressed some of the concerns of those threatening him, including fixing the faulty Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS). Results of 21 local government areas have been collated with two remaining (Degema and Obio-Akpor) before the incident. In a similar incident, the collation officer for the Nnewi South Local Government Area, Chinwe Isikpo, claimed that she had received death threats from unidentified individuals. The allegation caused tension and drama at the INEC Anambra State collation centre for the 2023 Presidential Election. Isikpo shouted in the collation hall on Monday after finishing her presentation of the Nnewi South LGA Presidential Election results to the presiding officer, Nnenna Oti. She claimed that some unidentified males had been following her since Sunday. After presenting her results, the collation officer abruptly raised the alarm, confusing everyone in the room and briefly halting operations. She was later led out of the room.
