THESE infographics give a pictorial representation of average fuel prices per litre cross the country. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCLtd) remains the sole importer of the product. However, it has licensed major oil marketers who assist in importing it. But the marketers, of course, factor in their logistic costs beyond the federal government’s official price peg. The third tier of importers are those who are not licensed to import but have to rely on third-party suppliers. These comprise mostly of independent marketers, whose prices of petrol per litre are higher than what are obtainable at NNPC and major marketers’ filling stations. By getting the product through third-party sources, they also factor in their costs, including distribution  logistics, beyond government’s official price peg in order to remain in business. The infographics represent average prices of petrol per litre, according to survey checks across the states.
