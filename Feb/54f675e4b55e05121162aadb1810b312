THE Bimodal Voter Accreditation System introduced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) can guarantee credible elections if allowed to work, according to the coordinator of the Labour Party (LP) Presidential Campaign Council in Ekiti State, Moses Jolayemi. Jolayemi said this on Saturday, February 18 at a town hall meeting with journalists at Damlek Events Centre, Ado Ekiti. BVAS is an electronic device designed to read and authenticate voters using their permanent voters’ cards. The party chieftain said LP’s Peter Obi’s would emerge victorious in the presidential poll if BVAS was not compromised. He said, “If BVAS is allowed to work, we will have credible, violence-free elections. If you look at the configuration of BVAS from the point of voting, collation and announcing results, there is no human intervention; with this, Peter Obi is the next president.” On February 25, INEC will conduct the presidential and National Assembly polls, while the governorship and state assembly elections will hold on March 11.
