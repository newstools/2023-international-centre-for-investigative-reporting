THE Labour Party (LP) candidate for the Eti-Osa Federal Constituency seat in the House of Representatives, Thaddeus Attah, has been declared winner by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The result was announced by the INEC Returning Officer Funmilayo Odukoya at the Collation Centre, Lagos State Model Nursery and Primary School in Lekki 1 on Sunday, February 26. Attah won with 24,075 votes. Bankole Wellington (Banky W) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) followed with a total of 18,666 and Babajide Obanikoro of the All Progressives Congress (APC) got 16,901 votes. According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), the APC and PDP party agents had contested the validity of the results, arguing that some units did not transmit the figures through the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS). The PDP agent Aderemi Adeshina also said voters were disenfranchised in some polling units. “We will not accept the result until another election takes place in all the wards where we were disenfranchised, “ he said. Banky W is losing the elections for the second time since he announced his decision to contest for a seat in the House of Representatives in 2018. He contested the House of Representatives seat under the Modern Democratic Party (MDP) in 2019, but lost to Ibrahim Obanikoro of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).
