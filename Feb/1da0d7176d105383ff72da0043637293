GUNMEN reportedly killed three persons during an attack on Maiyanga community in Bokkos Local Government Area (LGA) of Plateau State on Sunday, January 5. According to Punch Newspaper, two other persons were injured in the attack. Bulus Sule, a resident of the Maiyanga neighbourhood, confirmed the attack to The PUNCH and stated that those hurt had been transported to a hospital where they are currently receiving medical attention. Ilya, another resident, spoke out against the killings. He said that the attack was reported to the security personnel who, he claimed, had arrived in the neighbourhood many hours after the gunmen have departed. To prevent such assaults on the residents, he urged the government to step up security post in the area. Attempts to get the comment of the spokesman for the Plateau State Police Command, Alabo Alfred, were unsuccessful as he did not take his calls when reached. Also, he did not respond to a text message sent to his phone.
