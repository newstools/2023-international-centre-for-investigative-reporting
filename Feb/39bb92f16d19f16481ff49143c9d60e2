SIX suspects have been remanded in prison for their alleged involvement in the murder of a couple and their only surviving son in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. The suspects were brought before an Abeokuta magistrate court II on 11 counts, including murder, conspiracy to commit a felony, arson, stealing, and escape from a lawful authority. The suspected killers – Lekan Adekanbi, Ahmed Odetola, and Waheed Adeniyi – were remanded in Oba Correctional Centre, while their accomplices, Fadairo Temitope and Adekanbi Adenike, were remanded in the Ibara Correctional Centre. Two other suspects, Owolaja Anuoluwapo and Usman Azeez, suspected buyers of a vehicle stolen from the victims’ compound, were also remanded in Oba prison for 60 days. Pleas for the accused persons were not allowed due to the nature of the case, but an application for remand was moved by the applicant’s counsel, Oluwatosin Jackson. The court chief, Esther Idowu, ordered the suspects’ remand pending legal advice from the Department of Public Prosecution (DPP). Adekanbi, Odetola and Adeniyi had confessed they killed the couple, Kehinde Fatinloye and his wife inside their victims’ residence located in the Government Reservation Area (GRA) of the state capital on Sunday, January 1. They also confessed to killing the couple’s only child, Oreoluwa, by abducting him from the house and throwing him into a river at Adigbe in Abeokuta. Oreoluwa’s body was recovered from the river the day after the murder of his parents. According to the police, Adekanbi, who was the driver to the couple, masterminded the killings over their refusal to increase his salary and grant him a loan.
