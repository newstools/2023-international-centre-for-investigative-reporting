THE Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential campaign council has alleged that the Kaduna State governor, Nasir el-Rufai, is inciting Nigerians against President Muhammed Buhari’s directive on old naira notes. The party’s campaign spokesperson, Daniel Bwala, speaking on a Channels TV programme, said El-Rufai committed treason by countering Buhari’s claim on the validity of the N500 and N1,000 notes. Buhari had in a nationwide broadcast on Thursday February 16 directed the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to release the old N200 note into circulation, while the old N500 and N1,000 banknotes ceased to be legal tender. But el-Rufai had directed that the old and new notes remain valid in Kaduna State pending the Supreme Court judgment. Bwala said el-Rufai, by his action, was asking members of the ruling All Progressives Congress across the country to undermine the order of President Buhari “who stands as the symbol of the sovereignty of the country.” Rather than incite the people against the order, Bwala argued, el-Rufai should have reported the matter to the Supreme Court. He said the law dictates that when such a “matter comes up at the Supreme Court, you either get contempt proceedings against the president, or you will draw the attention of the Supreme Court.” Bwala also accused El-Rufai of defying court orders multiple times when he served as the minister of the Federal Capital Territory between 2003 and 2007, and also as a governor. The Supreme Court had on February 8 ruled that the old notes remain legal tender pending the determination of a case filed before it by three state governors. However, President Buhari’s address on Thursday would seem to have annulled that ruling.
