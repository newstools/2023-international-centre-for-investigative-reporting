He also narrated how a sole administrator who served under Buhari was sacked after suggesting that the period of naira swap be extended in 1984, when Buhari, as military ruler, also implemented the redesign of the naira. “Hassan Albadawi, who was Buhari’s commissioner for education when he was the governor of North Eastern State and later became the sole administrator at Gamboru Ngala on the border with Chad and Cameroon, appeared on television 9 o’clock news and begged the President to extend the time of naira swap because people in his constituency had no access to banks. Before the news ended, another message came, a special announcement, that he (Buhari) has dismissed the chairman of that local community,” Galadima said. The ICIR reported that the National Council of State expressed its support for the naira redesign policy introduced by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) during a meeting at the State House, Abuja, on February 10. The Council faulted gaps in the implementation of the policy which has led to acute agonies in accessing cash by people at commercial banks and ATMs, and asked the CBN to make new naira notes available to the public, or allow the new and old banknotes to circulate concurrently to ease the tension caused by the scarcity of cash.
