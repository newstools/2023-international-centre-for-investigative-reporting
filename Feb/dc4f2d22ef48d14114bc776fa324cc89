THE United Kingdom (UK) Metropolitan Police is investigating the death threat issued to British-Nigerian lawyer and activist Shola Mos-Shogbamimu by the National Action London Cell, a British right-wing extremist and Neo-Nazi terrorist organisation based in Warrington. Mos-Shogbamimu had raised alarm over a death threat she received from the organisation over her comments and activities against racism and inequality. The Metropolitan Police said that after being first made aware of the letter as a result of Twitter posts, the case was now being investigated by its Counter Terrorism Command. In a threat letter delivered to her home which contained vile racist and transphobic language, the National Action London Cell warned Mos-Shogbamimu to leave the UK or risk getting killed along with members of her family. “Shola you are a constant troublemaker and liar who appears on television frequently. You make shabby living from criticizing and race grifting against ethnic white Europeans and our culture. “We suggest you leave the UK ASAP. This is the only way you can avoid what is coming to you… It is only a matter of time before you receive your punishment, your execution,” parts of the letter which contained information about her home address read. Reacting to the threat, Mos-Shogbamimu said: “They don’t consider killing me ‘murder, they call it an execution. This letter was through my front door.” Another presenter and transgender activist India Willoughby, who has appeared on ITV’s Loose Women, confirmed in a reply to Mos-Shogbamimu’s tweet that she had also received a threatening letter.
