PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has appealed to Nigerians for more patience on hardships arising from the naira redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). In a statement issued on Sunday, February 19 by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari said the CBN designed the policy to improve Nigeria’s economy. According to the statement, Buhari, in a video recording from Ethiopia where he attended the just-concluded African Union summit, urged citizens to “exercise further patience,” noting that the hardship faced by many was due to “some policies of the government which are meant to bring overall improvement to the country.” He also vouched for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, whom he described as “reliable” and “well known for his achievements.” The President said, “I am not a contestant in this election, but my party, the All Progressives Congress, has a candidate in the person of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “As I mentioned, Tinubu is a true believer in Nigeria who loves the people and the development of our country. “I am calling on all of you to vote for Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. He is reliable, and I trust he will build on our achievements.”
