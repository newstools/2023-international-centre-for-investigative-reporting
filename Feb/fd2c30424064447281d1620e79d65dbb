THE Obi-Datti Media Office said it has uncovered a multi million naira fake news plot designed to smear the the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate Peter Obi by his counterpart in the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, ahead of this presidential election. Head of Media, Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign Council, Diran Onifade, who made this known in a statement on Monday, February 6, said the multi million media campaign is titled “Killer Punch”. Onifade said the fake news campaign is part of Tinubu’s plan to spread false information about Obi. He said anti-Obi elements have been contacted for a role in the “Killer Punch” documentary. According to Onifade, N500 million has been budgeted for the smear campaign. “Already, they have been releasing snippets of the documentary on social media, without getting any attention, as people already know about their desperation to drag down Obi, who they rightly know, is far ahead,” he said. “This documentary of lies and falsehood, which they have fabricated, attempt to portray Mr Obi as a drug peddler, killer and sexual pervert among other innuendos in their fertile imagination.” The Obi-Datti campaign team claimed that the APC campaign has been faltering and Tinubu is becoming increasingly frustrated with his media handlers. According to Onifade, Tinubu had reportedly accused his media handlers of not doing enough to halt Obi’s progress and has instructed them to spread more propaganda against his opponents, regardless of ethics or morality. Onifade noted that Obi has been the most fact-checked among the top four presidential candidates due to his issues-driven campaign. In the same vein, Onifade called on Nigerians to ignore any doctored or fake media news items about Obi. “The elections are just a few weeks away as Obi-Datti is growing by each second, let’s keep working hard, for the victory that will change our Country, for good,” Onifade added.
