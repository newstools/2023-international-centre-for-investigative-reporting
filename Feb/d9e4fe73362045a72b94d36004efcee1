THE Global Fund has approved nearly $1 billion for Nigeria to continue its fight against tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and HIV/AIDS for the next three years. Out of approximately 110 countries, Nigeria got the highest grant of $933,156,931, covering 2023 to 2025. The fund adds to almost $3 billion that the country has received since 2003. Nigeria is the single biggest recipient of Global Fund grants. It got over $1.5 billion for the 2017-2019 and 2020-2022 funding cycles. As of February 25, 2023, Nigeria had contributed $38.79 million to the Global Fund. It pledged $12 million for the Global Fund’s Sixth Replenishment, covering 2020-2022. The country is both a donor to the Global Fund and an implementer of programmes supported by the organization. The ICIR reports that African nations benefit more than any other continent from Global Fund’s grants because the three diseases are prevalent in the region. The ICIR also reports that though Nigeria needs more funds to combat many communicable and non-communicable diseases taking a high toll on the nation, many officials managing available funds have been accused of corruption, in many instances, with impunity. In 2020, Global Fund supported Nigeria with $294 million to fight COVID-19. The ICIR reported how the Global Fund, in its 2022 audit, accused the National Agency for Control of AIDS (NACA) and the Lagos State Government of misappropriating $19.6 million worth of COVID-19 procurement grants through shady contract awards. It was not the first time the Global Fund would accuse Nigeria of misusing its grants. In 2016, the Fund accused NACA and the National Malaria Elimination Programme (NMEP) of misappropriating the grants they got. The Global Fund consequently suspended them as its grant recipients. As of 2021, NACA was yet to clear itself of the 2016 indictment before the Nigerian government. According to the Global Fund, Nigeria has the third highest number of HIV infections globally: 1.7 million people living with HIV and AIDS. It has the highest TB burden in Africa, and the sixth highest globally. The ICIR reports that the country parades the highest number of global malaria cases and the highest number of deaths. The 2022 World Malaria Report showed that the nation contributed 27 per cent of global malaria cases. As of June 2022, organizations receiving grants from Global Fund in Nigeria are:
