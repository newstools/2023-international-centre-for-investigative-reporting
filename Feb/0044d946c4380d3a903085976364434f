PRESIDENTIAL candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, has promised to accept the choice of the majority in Lagos State. Tinubu said as a democrat, he was willing to accept the election outcome, whether favourable or not. He called for calm, saying the state election result should not trigger supporters and party members into violence and chaos. The former Lagos State governor said this in a statement issued on Monday by the Director, Media and Publicity, APC Presidential Campaign Council, Bayo Onanuga. Tinubu said narrowly losing Lagos state to another party should not be a reason for a breakdown in law and order, noting that the beauty of democracy was that people had a right to vote for the candidates of their choice. “The fact that the APC narrowly lost Lagos State to another party should not be the reason for violence. As a democrat, you win some, you lose some. We must allow the process to continue unhindered across the country while maintaining peace and decorum,” he said. He also expressed concern about violence in parts of the state and condemned the alleged attacks on some Igbo traders. Obi was declared the winner of Lagos after pulling 582,354 votes.
Tinubu trailed behind with 572,606 votes, while Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) garnered 75,750 votes.
