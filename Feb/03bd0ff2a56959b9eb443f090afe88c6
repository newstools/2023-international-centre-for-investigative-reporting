THE Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has postponed till today, Sunday 26, the Presidential and National Assembly polls in Yenagoa LGA of Bayelsa State. The Commission announced the postponement in a statement issued on Saturday night by Wilfred Ifoga, Head of Voter Education and Publicity. According to the statement, Epie I and Epie III, Gbarain II and Okordia are the affected registration areas. This is as a result of the inability of INEC to conduct elections in the four areas of Yenagoa because the process was disrupted by protesters. Reasons cited by the News Agency of Nigeria are the acute shortage of ballot papers and protest. The shortage of ballot papers in the areas prompted voters to stage a protest at the INEC Yenagoa office. The INEC officials discovered that only 1,500 ballot papers were available for about 50,000 potential voters and this prompted a protest, according to NAN.
