THE presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has urged Nigerians to channel frustrations over the scarcity of naira and fuel in the country to vote out the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Atiku, in a statement, said Nigerians must not allow the results of the 2023 presidential election to be determined by ‘bullion vans’. “The other side of the bargain is for us as Nigerians to use the power of our PVC to channel our frustration to vote out the APC in the forthcoming general election,” he said.

In the report, I aligned my position with an upsurge of demands for a slight extension of the January 31 deadline. “The frustration that we all go through at the moment can be corrected if the CBN continues to do its part and operatives of the EFCC and ICPC, too, ensure that people do not keep stacks of money out of reach of the public,” he added.
