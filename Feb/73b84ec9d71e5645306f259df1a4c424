THE Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has suspended the Enugu East Senatorial election due to the killing of Labour Party (LP) candidate Oyibo Chukwu. INEC chairman Mahmood Yakubu announced this on Friday, February 24 at a press conference held at the National Collation Centre in Abuja. Chukwu, a lawyer, was shot dead by unknown gunmen three days before the Presidential and National Assembly elections. According to several reports, Chukwu and other party members were killed late Wednesday night in Amaechi Awkunanaw, Enugu South Local Government Area, Enugu State. The reports say unidentified individuals approached them while they were travelling in a Sienna car, shot at them and set the vehicle on fire. The governorship candidate of the party in the state, Chijioke Edeoga, confirmed the incident. Giving an update on the development on Friday, Yakubu said the Enugu East Senatorial election will now be combined with the governorship and state assemblies’ elections on March 11. “This request is in line with the provision of the law, section 34(1) of the Electoral Act, 2022,” Yakubu said. Meanwhile, the presidential candidate of the LP in the forthcoming elections, Peter Obi, has condemned Chukwu’s killing. Obi also commiserated with the bereaved family, the Enugu East Senatorial Zone and the Labour Party family. He reacted to the killing in a series of tweets on his official Twitter handle on Thursday.
