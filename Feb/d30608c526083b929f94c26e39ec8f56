THE Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) did not initiate the Naira redesign policy to install an interim government or keep Muhammadu Buhari in office beyond May 29, according to a statement the Presidency issued on Friday, February 17. The Presidency is debunking a speculation that Buhari’s insistence on the policy was an effort to trigger chaos that would necessitate the imposition of an interim government. In the statement issued by Garba Shehu, President Buhari’s spokesperson, the Presidency described the talk of an interim government as “way off the mark.” Garba said the speculation was being peddled by people who “stand to gain nothing at all but the creation of panic and the incitement of the public against the Federal Government.” The statement noted that President Buhari was ready to relinquish power to the next elected president on May 29, 2023, as the Constitution stipulates. Garba also indicated that “there is a lot of pressure on everyone,” from political parties to electoral officials, presidential candidates, and law enforcement agencies due to recent events. He urged citizens to remain calm as national leaders address and resolve the issue of cash scarcity.
