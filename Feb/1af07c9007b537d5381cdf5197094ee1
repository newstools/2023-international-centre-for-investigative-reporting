LAGOS State governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has urged residents to remain calm amid the fuel and naira notes scarcity, among other challenges they have been experiencing. Sanwo-Olu made the appeal at a conference on Saturday, February 18, following series of protests against the scarcity, which erupted in many parts of the state during the week. Urging residents of Lagos to shun violence, the governor said efforts were being made to resolve the issue. “To my good people of Lagos, please resist the opportunists who seek to take advantage of the anger and frustration that you all are feeling to hijack the situation and foment trouble. “We know that there are unscrupulous persons who want to sow seeds of violence and discord through their very utterances and actions, all with the view of robbing you of the chance to cast your votes in the February 25 Presidential and National Assembly elections. Do not allow them to use you to achieve their evil intentions,” he said. The governor said there would be no tolerance for violence and destruction, adding that talks were ongoing with transport workers to avoid a hike in fares during this period. Protests had erupted along the Lagos-Ibadan expressway on Friday due to the scarcity of the new naira notes residents have been experiencing. Commuters were stranded as protesters blocked the highway, burning tires on the road. There were also protests along the Ketu/Mile 12 area of the state due to the rejection of old notes and unavailability of the new naira. Sanwo-Olu had also released a statement on Friday, February 17, appealing to residents to maintain peace despite the current challenges.
