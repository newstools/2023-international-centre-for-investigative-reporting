THE New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP) has called for the cancellation of the February 25 Presidential and National Assembly elections. The chairman of the NNPP, Rufai Ahmed Alkali, made the call while addressing the press in Abuja on Tuesday, February, 28. Alkali urged INEC to cancel the entire process. The party stated that the election results declared so far did not mirror the wishes of Nigerians. “We must be aware that, no matter the situation in our country, all leaders must consider the stability and security of the country as paramount. Our country is bigger than any individual and is certainly more important than any vested interest. “To save our democracy and our country, the present election results must not be accepted by Nigerians and by all friends of Nigeria. “We are therefore calling on the immediate suspension of the announcement of results and the cancellation of the 2023 presidential election across the country,” the NNPP said. The NNPP added that another election should be conducted as soon as possible. The party also accused INEC of deliberately blurring its logo on ballot papers. “We were shocked on the election day to discover that INEC has decided to use the most blurred image to represent the logo of NNPP.” The party said the blurred image that INEC put on the ballot for the NNPP did not include the name of the party. Earlier today, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Labour Party (LP) and the African Democratic Congress (ADC) called on INEC to suspend the ongoing collation of the results of the presidential election. Speaking on behalf of the three parties, the chairman of the LP, Julius Abure, alleged that INEC compromised the integrity of the February 25 Presidential and National Assembly elections. He equally called for the resignation of the INEC chairman.
