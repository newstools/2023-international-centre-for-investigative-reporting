THE Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said elections will not hold in 240 polling units across 28 states in the forthcoming general elections. INEC chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, who disclosed this on Monday, February 13, at a meeting with leaders of political parties, said there are no registered voters in the 240 polling units as a result of insecurity. “There are 240 polling units without registered voters spread across 28 states and the FCT. They range from one polling unit to 12 polling units in the states as FCT except Taraba and Imo states, with 34 and 38 polling units, respectively. “No new registrant chose the polling units, and no voter indicated interest to transfer to them during the last CVR mainly for security reasons. This means that no election would be held in these polling units,” he said. Yakubu is meeting with leaders of political parties ahead of the general elections. The meeting is taking place at the INEC Conference Room in Abuja. The INEC boss pleaded with the political parties to ensure that only accredited agents are allowed into the polling areas. He stressed that only those with INEC ID cards would be allowed. The INEC chairman also urged the political parties to call their candidates and supporters to order in the face of violent attacks that have been witnessed in some campaigns in recent days. The meeting is to bring the political parties up to speed with all the election preparations and remind them of their obligations. The meeting is still ongoing as of the time of filing this report.
