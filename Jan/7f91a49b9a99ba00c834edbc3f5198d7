He said, “With your support, I will fight corruption and block all areas of revenue leakages.” Obi also promised to stop the wastages in government and start saving to rebuild the country. “Opposition says I am stingy, but nobody has accused me or my running mate of corruption,’’ he said. He restated his resolve to fight poverty as a way of reducing crimes, positing that the more people that were pulled out of poverty, the more crime would be reduced. The presidential candidate also told the traditional rulers that if successful, he would be working with them to address security challenges facing Nigeria. In his remarks, the Chief of Kagoro, Ufuwai Bonet, appreciated Obi for identifying with the people of Southern Kaduna. Bonet prayed God for leaders that would address the numerous challenges confronting Nigeria.
