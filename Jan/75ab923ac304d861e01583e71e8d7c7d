The ongoing collection of PVCs nationwide will therefore continue and end on 5th February 2023. “This is the second time the Commission is extending PVC collection nationwide, and this will be the last extension of the exercise. The collection period has further been extended by an additional two hours and will start at 9 a.m. and end at 5 p.m. daily, including Saturdays and Sundays,” the statement said. The Commission urged Nigerians who are yet to pick their PVCs to do so. “The Commission once again salutes the patience and doggedness of citizens,” the statement added. The Commission said it would continue to take action on all reported cases of shady behaviour during the PVC collection exercise. It added that it would ensure that no Nigerian was adversely affected and that everyone with a valid registration had the opportunity to pick up their PVCs. INEC had earlier extended the deadline for the collection of PVCs from January 22 to January 29.
