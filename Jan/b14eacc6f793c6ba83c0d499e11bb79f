There is an obvious need to improve the state of the Fire Service in Akwa Ibom, considering that without the presence of the Federal Fire Service, the situation would have been more dire. Akwa Ibom’s state Fire Service Public Relations Officer, Emmanuel Udofia says 99 per cent of Fire outbreaks in Uyo are tackled with the Federal Fire service doing most of the work because they have more capacity. Despite the capacity shown by the Federal Fire Service, Ofonmbuk Nelson, the parastatal’s Commandant and 2IC in Akwa Ibom, says their operations are hampered due to the lack of a Water Hydrant for the refilling of the water tank. *This report is supported by the International Budget Partnership (IBP) and the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (The ICIR)
