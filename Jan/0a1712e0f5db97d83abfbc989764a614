Ibrahim, who is the GCC chairman, claimed that members of the state assembly were supporters of the party’s presidential candidate Peter Obi, and running mate Yussuf Datti Baba-Ahmed in next month’s presidential election. “Sincerely speaking, today is one of the happiest moments in my life. I have gone around to campaign for our presidential candidate Peter Obi and I have received great receptions. “I am particularly impressed by the calibre of personalities that grace this inauguration. In the entire Northern states, we don’t have any personality that dumps APC and joins the Labour Party except in Kaduna State with the Deputy Speaker and another member from Zaria constituency of the state,” he said.
