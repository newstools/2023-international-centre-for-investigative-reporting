AS ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) of the Federal Government begin the execution of government programmes for the 2023 financial year, The ICIR looks into what some government institutions budgeted for newspapers, magazines and periodicals within the year. The institutions are the Presidency, Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation (OHCSF) and 12 key government ministries. While the budgets for newspapers, magazines and periodicals run into several millions of naira in the selected ministries and other government institutions, some newspapers are sold between N200 and N300 in the country, but periodicals sell much higher. The ICIRâ€™s calculation shows that a budget of N1 million will purchase 4,000 copies of newspapers, meaning that a ministry that has a million naira budget for newspapers will have about 11 copies of the products every day of the year.
