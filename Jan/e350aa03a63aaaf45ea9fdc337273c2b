SOME shops at the Balogun market in Lagos State have been gutted by a midnight fire which began in the early hours of Thursday, January 26. The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) confirmed this in a statement. LASEMA Permanent Secretary Olufemi Oke-Osanyitolu who released the statement said the cause of the fire had not yet been ascertained. He also noted that there were no fatalities recorded as a result of the incident. “The agency responded to distress calls concerning the fire. Upon arrival at the scene operatives encountered a fire involving some shops on the ground floor of a three-storey building. “The cause of the fire could not be immediately ascertained.

Some traders had stocked up on goods worth millions of naira before the incident occurred. Similar fire incidents occurred in 2020 and 2019. One person died in the fire incident of 2020.
