THE Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said it has captured a total of 93,469,008 eligible voters in its voters register following the final clean-up of double registration and underage voters. The figure followed the review of 54,264 objections raised by Nigerians following the initial display of the voter register on its website in November 2022. INEC chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, disclosed this at a meeting with members of political parties at the commission’s headquarters in Abuja. Yakubu insisted that the 2023 elections would hold as planned as they do not contemplate any adjustment to the election timetable. He declared, “The 2023 General Election will hold as scheduled. Any report to the contrary is not the official position of the Commission.” He said the security agencies had repeatedly assured the commission of adequate protection of personnel, materials and processes. On the demography of the eligible voters, the commission said the total number of eligible voters rose by 9,464,924, or 11.3 per cent, from the 84,004,084 recorded in the 2019 general elections to 93,469,008 eligible voters in 2023. “Of this cumulative figure, 49,054,162 (52.5 per cent) are male, while 44,414,846 (47.5 per cent) are female,” he said.
