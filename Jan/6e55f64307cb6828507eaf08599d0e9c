According to Oyeyemi, the hoodlums wanted to set the vehicle ablaze so as to prevent investigation into the cause of the accident. He said the suspects attacked the policeman and the towing vehicle driver with a sledgehammer, stick and other dangerous weapons in order to prevent them from taking one of the vehicles involved to the station for further investigation. “The policeman and the towing vehicle driver managed to escape from the scene and ran to the station with varying degrees of injuries,” he added. “The Divisional Police Officer, Owode Egba division, CSP Olasunkanmi Popoola, when hinted, led his men to the place where he met the suspects who had already poured petrol on the towing vehicle and were about setting it ablaze after removing the cash sum of N520,000 belonging to the vehicle driver. “Three among the hoodlums were arrested, while others escaped but the remaining petrol was recovered from them.” The PPRO said the Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, has ordered that those who escaped must be hunted down and brought to book.
