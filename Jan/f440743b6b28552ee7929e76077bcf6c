Part of the statement read, “On Friday, at about 11:20 p.m. while the Speaker arrived at his residence at Federal Low-cost in Jos-south, three unidentified gunmen operating in an ash-coloured CRV Jeep, trailed him to his residence and attempted to enter his house to kidnap him. ”But their mission was made impossible by the intrepid police officers on guard duty, and the timely response of the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) Rantya Division, SP Ayuba Iliya and his men, who joined forces with the men on guard duty and repelled the evil act. ”However, the command is making a concerted effort to track down the fleeing suspects and get them arrested.” The PPRO stressed that the Commissioner of Police in the state Bartholomew Onyeka appreciated members of the public for volunteering timely information on security breaches in their various communities to the police for prompt action.
