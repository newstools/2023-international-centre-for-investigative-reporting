GUNMEN have attacked and killed four operatives of the Anambra Vigilante Services, in Anambra State, and also set five buildings ablaze. The incident took place on Thursday January 12 at the Ihiala local government area of the state. The attackers were said to have invaded the secretariat early in the morning, killing three vigilantes guarding the complex. The police spokesperson in Anambra State, Ikenga Tochukwu, has confirmed the development in a statement. Tochukwu said the attackers set several buildings in the secretariat on fire. According to him, security operatives, who responded to a distress call at about 2.55pm and engaged the attackers in a firefight, killed one of them. “The attackers had already murdered three vigilante operatives on duty, beheaded one, and set five buildings ablaze with IED and petrol bombs,” the PPRO stated.
